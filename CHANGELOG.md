## [1.4.0](https://github.com/Gusarovv/discord-card-canvas/compare/v1.3.1...v1.4.0) (2023-04-22)

### New feature:

* Added the ability to draw the image in the 'Cover' mode.  The image will retain its proportions when filling the block: the final size of the content will be defined as the "coverage" of the block, limited by its width and height.
* Now drawing options can be set when called .build()
> Example: `new BaseCardBuilder({ ... }).build({ objectFit: 'cover', only: ['background', 'nickname'] })`

> ðŸ”¹ By default, all images are still drawn in the 'fill' mode.
